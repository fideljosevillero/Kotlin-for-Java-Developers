Different Letters
Example 1
Secret ABCD and guess ABCD must be evaluated to: rightPosition = 4, wrongPosition = 0. All letters are guessed correctly in respect to their positions.

Example 2
Secret ABCD and guess CDBA must be evaluated to: rightPosition = 0, wrongPosition = 4. All letters are guessed correctly, but none has the right position.

Example 3
Secret ABCD and guess ABDC must be evaluated to: rightPosition = 2, wrongPosition = 2. A and B letters and their positions are guessed correctly. C and D letters are guessed correctly, but their positions are wrong.

At first, you can implement this easier task, when all the letters are different, and only after that start with the next part, when letters can be repeated. Run MastermindTestDifferentLetters to make sure you've implemented this part correctly.

Repeated Letters
Example 4
Secret AABC and guess ADFE must be evaluated to: rightPosition = 1, wrongPosition = 0. A at the first position is guessed correctly with its position. If we remove the first A from consideration (comparing the remaining ABC and DFE only), that will give us no more common letters or positions.

Example 5
Secret AABC and guess ADFA must be evaluated to: rightPosition = 1, wrongPosition = 1. The first A letter is guessed correctly with its position. If we remove this letter from consideration (comparing the remaining ABC and DFA), we find the second A letter which is guessed correctly but stays at the wrong position.

Example 6
Secret AABC and guess DFAA must be evaluated to: rightPosition = 0, wrongPosition = 2. No letters are guessed correctly concerning their positions. When we compare the letters without positions, A is guessed correctly. Since A is present twice in both guess and secret, it must be counted two times.

Example 7
Secret AABC and guess DEFA must be evaluated to: rightPosition = 0, wrongPosition = 1. The letter A occurs only once in the second string, that's why it counted only once as staying at the wrong position.

After implementing the task for repeated letters, run MastermindTestDifferentLetters to make sure it works correctly.
